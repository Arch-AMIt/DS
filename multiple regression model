# Multiple Linear Regression - Exercise
You are given a real estate dataset. 

Real estate is one of those examples that every regression course goes through as it is extremely easy to understand and there is a (almost always) certain causal relationship to be found.

The data is located in the file: 'real_estate_price_size_year.csv'. 

You are expected to create a multiple linear regression (similar to the one in the lecture), using the new data. 

In this exercise, the dependent variable is 'price', while the independent variables are 'size' and 'year'.

Good luck!
## Import the relevant libraries
import pandas as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.api as sm
import seaborn as sns
sns.set()

#these library needed to analyse the data and to show it in better form
## Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('real_estate_price_size_year.csv')  #to read .csv data(in same directory)
data.head()  #prints first 5 data of dataset
data.describe()  #to describe the behaviour and basic details of data
## Create the regression
### Declare the dependent and the independent variables
y = data['price']          #assigning y axis to the dependent varibales(y cap)
x1 = data[['size','year']] #asssigning the independent varibales to x axis

### Regression
x = sm.add_constant(x1)     #to add the constant to x1(basically the intercept)
results = sm.OLS(y,x).fit() # to find coeeficient of independent variables 
results.summary()           #gives out the result of fitting the data
